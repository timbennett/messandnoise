# messandnoise
Mess + Noise was an Australian music news website and discussion forum. It was taken over by Junkee Media and later shut down. This is a partial archive created during its decommissioning.

Another archive is available at [NLA's Pandora Archive](http://pandora.nla.gov.au/tep/151589). I'm not sure how much of the content in this repository crosses over with the Pandora archive, but I think we each may have some content that the other doesn't.

## Using the site
Download the project and open index.html in your browser. Scraped article data is also available as an Excel workbook.
